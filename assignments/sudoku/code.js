/* Quick guide! Read to understand a bit better.
(Right click on any of the things in 'quotes' -> "Go to References" to see some of what they do.)
start by choosing the amount of 'attempts' every time you click.
  - Feel free to set this to any (positive) number (integer), but be careful!
    * Setting it too high will make it crash, and it will slow down heavily (30s wait) in the billions!
    * Due to the rounding, a low number may give a lot of 0's.
  - After choosing your attempt count, you may change the 'multiplier' of the returned number.
    * This should only be used in testing or to have fun, as it will overrepresent amounts of anomalies.
    * The recommended 'multiplier' is 1, anything less (above 0) will result in more 'lowAnomalies', and vice versa.
  - Now you choose the mode that you would like the text to be displayed in:
    * 'sci'; Scientific notation, relatively straightforward. (10,000 -> 1.0 * 10^4)
    * 'power'; Takes the power of 10 that would be applied in 'sci'.
    * 'trunc'; Truncation, the most complicated but best looking number representation.
      ~ Similar to 'sci', in that it takes the first few digits and shows a multiplication.
      ~ However, this uses letters to show the multiplication.
      ~ A "k" represents a multiplication of a thousand, "m" of one million, "b" of a billion, and so on.
      ~ If you need more precise results, however, this may not be for you.
      ~ This method cuts off all but the first 4 digits, causing some detail to be lost.
    * 'avg'; A straightforward representation of the average of all results.
    * Anything else will default to the raw number.
  - 'logs' can be useful if you are looking for some metric in particular.
    * 'logs' stores all clicks' results in an array that can be accessed with 'logs.array' in REPL.
    * You can also find the amount of each anomaly within 'logs', along with the total number of clicks and anomalies.
  - The console log will show you the latest number (first of your mode, then natural), attempt count, and current average.
  - You should be good to go! (: Have fun tweaking the variables to see what you like best. 
? (if you'd like to know how this works, I have written it out at the bottom, but try to figure it out yourself!)
