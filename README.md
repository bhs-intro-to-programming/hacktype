# BHS Intro to Programming

This is MY repo where I keep the code I write in this course.

Initially I won't have to interact directly with git as the tools at
https://intro.gigamonkeys.com/ will commit code to this repo for ME
automatically. (YOU will explain to ME how to use this repo to submit
MY assignments in the form of "Pull requests".)

Later in the year we will work more directly with git and GitHub.

This repo is MINE (i.e. each student has their own) however the tools
YOU built do need it to be structured in a particular way. For now, please 
do not rename or restructure things, even if I AM already familiar
with git or GitHub. Later on, as we get a bit further into using git, 
we may loosen that up a bit.
